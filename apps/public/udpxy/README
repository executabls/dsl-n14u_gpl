Summary
--------------

udpxy is a UDP-to-HTTP multicast traffic relay daemon:
it forwards UDP traffic from a given multicast subscription
to the requesting HTTP client.

udpxy is released under GPL v.3

Building and installing
--------------

Untar the *.tgz source distribution into a directory of your choice by
running
        tar -xzvf udpxy.X.Y-ZZ.tgz
    or
        gzip -dc udpxy.X.Y-ZZ.tgz | tar -xvf -

Make sure make and gcc are available (gcc 3.x and up should work, lower
versions are not guaranteed to build the source correctly); for compilers
other than gcc alterations to makefile might be needed.

Running 'make' without a target will build the 'release' version of
udpxy (no asserts, no debug symbols, verbose mode on).

Other make targets are:
    debug (asserts, debug symbols, verbose mode on);
    lean  (no asserts, no debug symbols, verbose mode off)

Once the make has succeeded, the udpxy executable file could be
copied to a location of one's choice and run from there - no additional
installation steps are required.

udpxy can be started with a number of configuration parameters,
such as listening address/port, multicast interface name, etc.
A brief usage summary is provided when udpxy is invoked from command line
without parameters.

HTTP commands
--------------

udpxy responds to HTTP (GET) commands to receive data from
a dedicated multicast group and forward it to the initiating (HTTP)
connection.

The command to relay traffic is in the format as below:

http://address:port/cmd/mgroup_address[SEP]mgroup_port/

[SEP] ::= :|%|~|+|-|^
i.e:
    http://ip:port/cmd/mgroup_address:mgroup_port/
    http://ip:port/cmd/mgroup_address%mgroup_port/
    http://ip:port/cmd/mgroup_address~mgroup_port/
    ......
    http://ip:port/cmd/mgroup_address^mgroup_port/

are acceptable and should all work in the same manner.

cmd ::= udp | rtp

where address and port match the listening address/port combination of udpxy,
and mgroup_address:mgroup_port identify the multicast group to subscribe to.

Using 'udp' command will instruct udpxy to probe for known types of payload
(such as MPEG-TS and RTP over MPEG-TS); using 'rtp' makes udpxy assume RTP
over MPEG-TS payload, thus skipping the probes.

udpxy will start a 'client' process for each new relay request as long as
their number would not exceed a pre-set maximum (see usage summary).

udpxy also supports a few additional HTTP requests, such as:

http://address:port/status/  - to display basic daemon's statistics
http://address:port/restart/ - to close all active connections and restart

Payload types and handling
--------------

udpxy recognizes MPEG-TS and RTP (over MPEG-TS) payloads within relayed packets;
if udpxy encounters RTP payload it automatically 'translates' it to MPEG-TS so that
media players not recognizing RTP on TCP could still play back the stream.

So far, no translation is performed for other payload types.

Recording MPEG traffic
--------------
udpxy (in builds >33) includes functionality to record captured traffic as
raw MPEG-TS stream into a file. This functionality is enabled through udpxrec:
a bundled-in application that is linked together with udpxy (as one executable).

udpxrec is invoked by a symbolic link (named udpxrec) to the udpxy executable
(NB: do not rename udpxy executable).

udpxrec creates MPEG files encapsulating MPEG-TS segments; most media players
will *NOT* play such files; to make them playable the stream must be transcoded
to MPEG-PS; vlc knows how to do such transcoding, here is a command-line example:

vlc input-ts.mpg --sout="#std{access=file,mux=ps,dst=out-ps.mpg}"

The resulting PS file can be played back by most media players.

Portability
--------------
udpxy was written to run on 'POSIX-compliant' systems;
so far all builds have been tested to build and run on Linux 2.4, 2.6 (IA32, ARM)
and *some* (but not all) on HP-UX 11.11 (PA-RISC 1.1, 2.0w).

Build 12 of version 1.0 (Chipmunk) was ported to compile under FreeBSD 7.1
using GNU make 3.8
