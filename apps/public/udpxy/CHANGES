    (*) -H parameter added to set max time data can be held in buffer

    (*) added pid to log output

Version 1.0 'Chipmunk'
--------------------------

Build 1 (4-June-2008)
    (*) same as Build 39

Build 2 (6-June-2008)
    (*) Rolled back WMP-compatibility changes

Build 6 (12-August-2008)
    (*) Fixed: udpxrec would not write beyond 2Gb; -M option would not accept >2Gb of size

Build 7 (20-September-2008)
    (*) Fixed: multicast-resubscribe default period of zero seconds would cause udpxy to resubscribe
        on every iteration; logic changed to make udpxy re-subscribe only on setting's value >0
        (0 means 'do NOT' re-subscribe)

Build 8 (3-December-2008)
    (*) SIGPIPE is ignored now (was handled as a signal to quit)
    (*) Full version info is displayed on exit
    (*) PAUSE support (non-blocking receive socket) can be disabled
    (*) DHOLD_TIMEOUT (default max time to buffer data before flush) set to 4 seconds

Build 9 (17-February-2009)
    (*) documentation (in Russian) added
    (*) default buffer size changed to 4K, was 64K
    (*) minimal send-socket buffer length set to 32K (was previously set to data buffer size)
    (*) UDPXY_SENDBUF_LEN environment variable can be set to control send-socket buffer size

Build 10 (24-February-2009)
    (*) read-socket buffer left untouched if bigger than suggested buffer value based on -R
        and -B parameters and the minimum buffer size - currently 32K - for send socket
    (*) UDPXY_SENDBUF_LEN replaced by UDPXREC_SOCKBUF_LEN: that will be the minimum size
        for both read- and send-socket buffers (ignored still if set to less than 32K)
    (*) send-socket buffer size will be enlarged to the size of read-socket bufffer size
        (if currently smaller)

Build 11 (25-February-2009)
    (*) UDPXY_DSOCKBUF_NOSYNC set to 1 will leave send-socket buffer size unaltered
    (*) UDPXY_SSOCKBUF_NOSYNC set to 1 will leave read (mcast)-socket buffer size unaltered
    (*) default buffer size (-B) changed to 2K, was 4K
    (*) default value for -R (messages to buffer) set to 1
    (*) minimum (advisory) socket buffer size set to 64K, was 32K
    (*) Fixed: assert when processing RTP-TS with -R 1
    (*) Fixed: if2addr() not working under 64-bit linux; -a and -m options would not accept ifc names
    (*) Fixed: quit flag value cast incorrectly under 64-bit linux
    (*) CFLAGS variable may used for additional compiler options (CFLAGS='-m32' will force 32-bit build, for instance)
    (*) NOP statements in udpxy.c, udpxrec.c updated to compile w/o warnings under gcc 3.2.3
    (*) util/mkipk.sh script added to create IPKG packages

Build 12 (9-April-2009)
    (*) ported to compile under FreeBSD 7.1 (32-bit)

Build 13 (10-April-2009)
    (*) signedness comparison warnings eliminated

Build 14 (23-Jul-2009)
    (*) ported to compile under FreeBSD 5.5 (32-bit)

Build 15 (XX-Mar-2010)
    (*) FIXED: not compiling with -O2/O3 flags under gcc (select additional options in USER_OPT env variable)
    (*) FIXED: would not allow running more than one udpxy daemon

Build 16 (21-Mar-2010)
    (*) FIXED: hanging when specifying network interface by name

Build 17 (27-Jun-2010)
    (*) FIXED: server terminates on ECONNABORTED from accept()
    (*) Dynamic memory allocation for HTTP status pages implemented - will not truncate pages

Build 18 (9-Jan-2011)
    (*) IP/port separator in HTTP request to udpxy can be any of those: ":%~+-^"

Build 19 (9-Jan-2011)
    (*) MAX limit of clients (-c option) upped to 5,000 (five thousand)
