* Version 2.3.2: March 10, 2016

Bug fix release.  All users should upgrade, in particular FreeBSD users!

** Changes
- Minor code cleanup and readability changes to simplify the code.
- Update to libite v1.4.2 with improved =min()=/=max()= macros
- Use =-Wextra= not =-Werror= in default =CFLAGS=, this to ensure that pimd
  still builds OK on newer and more pedantic compilers
- Update man page and example `pimd.conf` with details on `rp-candidate`
  `bsr-candidate`, two very important settings for correct operation.

** Bug Fixes
- Issue #57: Multicast routing table not updated on FreeBSD.  Introduced
  with issue #23, in pimd v2.2.0. Too intrusive changes altered handling
  (forwarding) of PIM register messages.  This only affects BSD systems,
  in particular FreeBSD 10.2 (current), or any FreeBSD < 11.0
- Issue #63: Mika Joutsenvirta <mailto:mika.joutsenvirta@insta.fi> found
  and fixed serious issues with the PIM Assert timeout handling.
- Issue #65: Missing slash in config file path when using env. variable
- Issue #66: Make it possible to run =pimd= without a configuration
  file.  If =pimd= cannot find its configuration file it will use
  built-in fallback settings for =bsr-candidate= and =rp-candidate=.
  This to ensure you do not end up with a non-working setup.  To disable
  =bsr-candidate= and =rp-candidate=, simply leave them out of your
  config file, and make sure =pimd= can find the file.
- Issue #69: Rate limit only what is actually logged.  The =logit()=
  function counted filtered messages, causing long periods of silence
  for no reason.  Fix by Apollon Oikonomopoulos <mailto:apollon@skroutz.gr>

* Version 2.3.1: November 15, 2015

Bug fix release.

** Changes
- Let build system handle missing libite GIT submodule
- Issue #61: Debian packaging moved to https://github.com/bobek/pkg-pimd

** Bug Fixes
- Issue #53: Build problem with Clang on FreeBSD
- Issue #55: Default config uses =/etcpimd.conf= instead of
  =/etc/pimd.conf=.  Slashes added and now =pimd -h= lists
  the default path instead of a hard coded string.
- Issue #60: Fix minor spelling errors.

* Version 2.3.0: July 31, 2015 -- /PIM-SSM & IGMPv3 release!/

The significant new features in this release would not have been
possible if not for the hard work of Markus Veranen
<mailto:markus.veranen@gmail.com>

Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 (GLIBC/Linux 3.13), Debian 8.1 (GLIBC/Linux
3.16), FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD.

** Changes and New Features
  - Support for PIM-SSM and IGMPv3, by Markus Veranen
  - IGMPv3 is now default, use =phyint ifname igmpv2= for old behaviour
  - Default IGMP query interval has changed from 125 sec to 12 sec

    In =pimd.conf: igmp-query-interval <SEC>=

  - Default IGMP querier timeout has changed from 255 sec to 42 sec

    In =pimd.conf: igmp-querier-timeout <SEC>=

  - The built-in IGMP /robustness value/ changed from 2 to 3
  - Support for changing the PIM Hello interval, by Markus Veranen

    In =pimd.conf: hello-interval <SEC>=

  - Support for multiple multicast routing tables, and running multiple
    pimd instances, by Markus Veranen.  (Only supported on Linux atm.)
  - Support for advertising, and acting upon changes to, Generation ID
    in PIM Hello messages, by Markus Veranen
  - Support for advertising /DR Priority/ option in PIM Hello messages.
    If all routers on a LAN send this option this value is used in the
    DR election rather than the IP address.  The priority is configured
    per =phyint=.  This closes the long-standing issue #5.
  - Distribution archive format changed from XZ to Gzip, for the benefit
    of OpenBSD that only ships Gzip in the base system.

** New pimd.conf syntax!

The =pimd.conf= syntax has been changed in this release.  Mainly, the
configuration file now use dashes =-= instead of underscore =_= as word
separators.  However several settings have also been renamed to be more
familiar to commands used by major router vendors:

   - =bsr-candidate= :: replaces =cand_bootstrap_router=
   - =rp-candidate= :: replaces =cand_rp=
   - =group-prefix= :: replaces =group_prefix=
   - =rp-address= :: replaces =rp_address=
   - =spt-threshold= :: replaces the two deprecated
        =switch_register_threshold= and =switch_data_threshold= settings
   - =hello-interval= :: replaces =hello_period=
   - =default-route-distance= :: replaces =default_source_preference=
   - =default-route-metric= :: replaces =default-source-metric= 

Also, for =phyint= the =preference= sub-option has been replaced with
the less confusing =distance= and =ttl-threshold= replaces =threshold=.
See the README or the man page for more information on the metric
preference and admin distance confusion.

/*Note:* The =pimd.conf= parser remains backwards compatible with the
old syntax!/


** Compile Time Features

The following are new features that must be enabled at compile time,
using the =configure= script, to take effect.  For details, see
=./configure --help=

  - =--prefix=PATH= :: Standard prefix to be used at installation,
       default =/usr/local=
  - =--sysconfdir=PATH= :: Prefix path to be used for =pimd.conf=,
       default =/etc=, unless =--prefix= is given.
  - =--embedded-libc= :: Enable uClib or musl libc build, on Linux.
  - =--disable-exit-on-error= :: Allow pimd to continue running despite
       encountering errors.
  - =--disable-pim-genid= :: Disable advertisement of PIM Hello GenID,
       use for compatibility problems with older versions of pimd.
  - =--with-max-vifs=MAXVIFS= :: Raise max number of VIFs to MAXVIFS.

       *Note:* this requires raising MAXVIFS in the kernel as well!
       Most kernels cannot handle >255, if this is a problem, try using
       multiple multicast routing tables instead.
  - =--disable-masklen-check= :: Allow tunctl VIFs with masklen 32.


** Bug Fixes
  - Fix issue #40: FTBS with =./configure --enable-scoped-acls=
  - Properly support cross compiling.  It is now possible to actually
    define the =$CROSS= environment variable when calling =make= to
    allow cross compiling pimd.  Should work with both GCC and Clang.
    Tested on Ubuntu, Debian and FreeBSD.

#+LATEX: \newpage
* Version 2.2.1: April 20, 2015
** Bug Fixes
  - Fix another problem with issue #22 (reopened), as laid out in
    issue #37.  This time the crash is induced when there is a link down
    event.  Lot of help debugging the propblem by @mfspeer, who also
    suggested the fix -- to call =pim_proto.c:delete_pim_nbr()= in
    =vif.c:stop_vif()= instead of just calling free.
  - Fix issue with not checking return value of =open()= in daemonizing
    code in =main()=, found by Coverity Scan.
  - Fix issue with scoped =phyint= in =config.c=, found by Coverity Scan.
    The =masklen= may not be zero, config file problem, alert the user.
    

#+LATEX: \newpage

  - Add very simple homegrown configure script
  - Update and document support for =rp_address=, =cand_rp=, and
    =cand_bootstrap_router=
  - Add new =spt_threshold= to replace existing =switch_register_threshold=
    and =switch_data_threshold settings=.  Cisco-like and easier to understand

** Bug Fixes

  - Fix bug in bootstrap when configured as candidate RP, issue #15
  - Fix segfault in =accept_igmp()=, issue #29
  - Fix default source preference, should be 101 (not 1024!)

    Cochard-Labb√©, issue #23
  - Fix default prefix len in static RP example in =pimd.conf=, should be /4
  - Fix issue #31: Make IGMP query interval and querier timeout configurable
  - Fix issue #33: pimd does not work in background under FreeBSD
  - Fix issue #35: support for timing out other queriers from mrouted
  - Hopefully fix issue #22: Crash in (S,G) state when neighbor is lost
  - Misc. bug fixes thanks to Coverity Scan, static code analysis tool
    https://scan.coverity.com/projects/3319


#+LATEX: \newpage
* Version 2.1.8: October 22, 2011
** Changes & New Features
  - Update docs of static Rendez-Vous Point, =rp_address=, configuration
    in man page and example =pimd.conf=.  Thanks to Andriy Senkovych
    <mailto:andriysenkovych@gmail.com> and YAMAMOTO Shigeru <mailto:shigeru@iij.ad.jp>

  - Replaced =malloc()= with =calloc()= to mitigate risk of accessing
    junk data and ease debugging.  Thanks to YAMAMOTO Shigeru
    <mailto:shigeru@iij.ad.jp>

  - Extend .conf file =rp_address= option with =priority= field.  Code
    changes and documentation updates by YAMAMOTO Shigeru
    <mailto:shigeru@iij.ad.jp>

** Bug Fixes
  - A serious bug in =pim_proto.c:receive_pim_register()= was found and
    fixed by Jean-Pascal Billaud.  In essence, the RP check was broken
    since the code only looked at =my_cand_rp_address=, which is not set
    when using the =rp_address= config.  Everything works fine with
    auto-RP mode though. This issue completely breaks the register path
    since the JOIN(S,G) is never sent back ...

  - Fix FTBFS issues reported from Debian. Later GCC versions trigger unused
    variable warnings. Patches and cleanup Antonin Kral <mailto:a.kral@bobek.cz>

* Version 2.1.7: January 9, 2011
** Changes & New Features
  - The previous move of runtime dump files to =/var/lib/misc= have been
    changed to =/var/run/pimd= instead.  This to accomodate *BSD systems
    that do not have the =/var/lib= tree, and also recommended in the
    Filesystem Hierarchy Standard,
    http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#VARRUNRUNTIMEVARIABLEDATA


#+LATEX: \newpage
* Version 2.1.6: January 8, 2011
** Changes & New Features
  - Debian package now conflicts with =smcroute=, in addition to
    =mrouted=.  It is only possible to run one multicast routing daemon
    at a time, kernel limitation.

  - The location of the dump file(s) have been moved from =/var/tmp= to
    =/var/lib/misc= due to the insecure nature of =/var/tmp=.  See more
    below.

** Bug Fixes
  - =kern.c:k_del_vif()=: Fix build error on GNU/kFreeBSD

  - CVE-2011-0007: Insecure file creation in =/var/tmp=.  "On USR1, pimd
    will write to =/var/tmp/pimd.dump= a dump of the multicast route
    table.  Since =/var/tmp= is writable by any user, a user can create
    a symlink to any file he wants to destroy with the content of the
    multicast routing table."

* Version 2.1.5: November 21, 2010
** Changes & New Features
  - Improved error messages in kern.c
  - Renamed CHANGES to ChangeLog

** Bug Fixes
  - Import mrouted fix: on GNU/Linux systems (only!) the call to
    =kern.c:k_del_vif()= fails with: =setsockopt MRT_DEL_VIF on vif 3:
    Invalid argument=.  This is due to differences in the Linux and *BSD
    =MRT_DEL_VIF= API.  The Linux kernel expects to receive a =struct
    vifctl= associated with the VIF to be deleted, *BSD systems on the
    other hand expect to receive the index of that VIF.

    Bug reported and fixed on mrouted by Dan Kruchinin <mailto:dkruchinin@acm.org>

** Changes & New Features
  - Integrated the latest Debian patches from =pimd_2.1.0-alpha29.17-9.diff.gz=

  - Fixed the new file include/linux/netinet/in-my.h (Debian) so that the
    #else fallback uses the system netinet/in.h, which seems to work now.

  - Bumped version number, this code has been available for a while now.


#+LATEX: \newpage

    the OpenBSD folks for the 2 years of hard work to make this happen:

    http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.sbin/mrouted/LICENSE

  - Moved the pimd contact email address upfront in README.  Let me repeat that here:
    If you have any questions, suggestions, bug reports, etc., do NOT send them to
    the PIM IETF Working Group mailing list!  Instead, use the contact email address
    specified in README.

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.16: February 18, 2003
** Bug Fixes
  - Compilation bugfix for Linux.  Bug report by Serdar Uezuemcue
    <mailto:serdar@eikon.tum.de>

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.15: February 12, 2003
** Bug Fixes
  - Routing socket descriptor leak.  Bug report and fix by SUZUKI Shinsuke
    <mailto:suz@crl.hitachi.co.jp>; incorporated back from pim6sd.

  - PIM join does not go upstream.  Bug report and fix by SUZUKI Shinsuke
    <mailto:suz@crl.hitachi.co.jp>; incorporated back from pim6sd.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    [problem]
    PIM join does not go upstream in the following topology, because oif-list
    is NULL after subtracting iif from oif-list.

        receiver---rtr1---|
                   rtr2---|---rtr3----sender

                rtr1's nexthop to sender = rtr2
                rtr2's nexthop to sender = rtr3

    [reason]
    Owing to a difference between RFC2362 and the new pim-sm draft.
    [solution]
    Prunes iif from oiflist when installing it into kernel, instead of
    PIM route calculation time.

  - If there is an error in the conf file, pimd won't start.

  - GRE configuration examples added to README.config.

  - New file README.debug (still very short though).

** Bug Fixes
  - Increase the config line buffer size to 1024.  Bug fix by Hiroyuki Komatsu

** Changes & New Features
  - Better log messages for point-to-point links in config.c.  Thanks to Hitoshi
    Asaeda <mailto:asaeda@yamato.ibm.com>

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.7: September 10, 2001
** Changes & New Features
  - Added "phyint altnet" (see pimd.conf for usage) for allowing some senders look
    like directly connected to a local subnet.  Implemented by Marian Stagarescu
    <mailto:marian@bile.cidera.com>

  - Added "phyint scoped" (see pimd.conf for usage) for administartively disabling
    the forwarding of multicast groups.  Implemented by Marian Stagarescu
    <mailto:marian@bile.cidera.com>

  - The License has changed from the original USC to the more familiar BSD-like (the
    KAME+OpenBSD guys brought to my attention that the original working in the USC
    license "...and without fee..."  is ambiguous and makes it sound that noone can
    distribute pimd as part of some other software distribution and charge for that
    distribution.

  - RSRR disabled by default in Makefile

** Bug Fixes
  - Memory leaks bugs fixed in rp.c, thanks to Sri V <mailto:vallepal@yahoo.com>

  - Compilation problems for RedHat-7.1 fixed.  Bug report by Philip Ho
    <mailto:cbho@ie.cuhk.edu.hk>

  - PID computation fixed (it should be recomputed after a child =fork()=).
    Thanks to Marian Stagarescu <mailto:marian@bile.cidera.com>

  - =find_route()=-related bug fixes (always explicitly check for NULL return).  Bug
    report by Marian Stagarescu <mailto:marian@bile.cidera.com>

  - Bug fix re. adding a local member with older ciscos (in =add_leaf()=). Bug report
    by Marian Stagarescu <mailto:marian@bile.cidera.com>

  - Added explicit check whether =BYTE_ORDER= in pimd.h is defined.  Bug report by
    <mailto:mistkhan@indiatimes.com>

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.6: May  4, 2001
** Bug Fixes
   - Bug fixes in processing Join/Prune messages.  Thanks to Sri V
     <mailto:vallepal@yahoo.com>

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.5: February 22, 2001
** Changes & New Features
   - =VIFM_FORWARDER()= macro renamed to =VIFM_LASTHOP_ROUTER=.

   - Mini-FAQ entries added to README.

** Bug Fixes
   - When there is a new member, =add_leaf()= is called by IGMP code for any router,
     not only for a DR. The reason is because not only the DR must know about local
     members, but the last-hop router as well (so eventually it will initiate a SPT
     switch).  Similar fixes to =add_leaf()= inside route.c as well.  Problem
     reported by Hitoshi Asaeda <mailto:asaeda@yamato.ibm.com>.  XXX: Note the
     lenghty comment in the beginning of =add_leaf()= about a pimd desing problem
     that may result in SPT switch not initiated immediately by the last-hop router.

   - DR entry timer bug fix in timer.c: When (*,G)'s iif and (S,G)'s iif are not
     same, (S,G)'s timer for the DR doesn't increase.  Reported indirectly by
     <mailto:toshiaki.nakatsu@fujixerox.co.jp>

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.4: December  1, 2000
** Changes & New Features
   - README cleanup + Mini-FAQ added

   - =igmp_proto.c=: printf argument cleanup (courtesy KAME)

   - =main.c:restart()=: forgotten printf argument added (courtesy KAME)

** Bug Fixes
   - =kern.c:k_stop_pim()=: Fix the ordering of =MRT_PIM= and =MRT_DONE=,
     thanks to Hitoshi Asaeda <mailto:asaeda@yamato.ibm.co.jp>.

   - =route.c:add_leaf()=: mrtentry creation logic bug fix. If the router is not a
     DR, a mrtentry is never created.  Tanks to Hitoshi Asaeda
     <mailto:asaeda@yamato.ibm.co.jp> & (indirectly)
     <mailto:toshiaki.nakatsu@fujixerox.co.jp>

   - =pim_proto.c=: Two critical bug fixes.  J/P prune suppression related message
     and J/P message with (*,*,RP) entry inside.  Thanks to Azzurra Pantella
     <mailto:s198804@studenti.ing.unipi.it> and Nicola Dicosmo from University of
     Pisa

   - =pim_proto.c:receive_pim_bootstrap()=: BSR-related fix from Kame's pim6sd.
     Even when the BSR changes, just schedule an immediate advertisemnet of C-RP-ADV,
     instead of sending message, in order to avoid sending the advertisement to the
     old BSR.  In response to comment from <mailto:toshiaki.nakatsu@fujixerox.co.jp>

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.3: October 13, 2000
** Bug Fixes
   - =ADVANCE()= bug fix in routesock.c (if your system doesn't have =SA_LEN=)
     thanks to Eric S. Johnson <mailto:esj@cs.fiu.edu>

* Version 2.1.0-alpha29.2: October 13, 2000
NB: THIS pimd VERSION WON'T WORK WITH OLDER PIM-SM KERNEL PATCHES (kernel
    patches released prior to this version)!

** Changes & New Features
  - The daemon that the kernel will prepare completely the inner multicast packet for
    PIM register messages that the kernel is supposed to encapsulate and send to the
    RP.

  - Now pimd compiles on OpenBSD-2.7. PIM control messages exchange test passed.
    Ddon't have the infrastructure to perform more complete testing.

  - =main.c:cleanup()=: Send =PIM_HELLO= with holdtime of '0' if pimd is going away,
    thanks to JINMEI Tatuya <mailto:jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>

  - =include/netinet/pim.h= updated

  - pimd code adapted to the new =struct pim= definition.

  - Added =PIM_OLD_KERNEL= and =BROKEN_CISCO_CHECKSUM= entries in the Makefile.

  - Don't ignore kernel signals if any of src or dst are NULL.

  - Don't touch =ip_id= on a PIM register message

  - README cleanup: kernel patches location, obsoleted systems clarification, etc.

  - =k_stop_pim()= added to =cleanup()= in =main.c= (courtesy Kame)

** Bug Fixes
  - =RANDOM()=-related bug fix re. =jp_value= calculation in =pim_proto.c=,
    thanks to JINMEI Tatuya <mailto:jinmei@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp>

  - =realloc()= related memory leak bug in =config_vifs_from_kernel()= in config.c
    courtesy Kame's pim6sd code.

  - Solaris-8 fixes thanks to Eric S. Johnson <mailto:esj@cs.fiu.edu>

  - =BROKEN_CISCO_CHECKSUM= bug fix thanks to Eric S. Johnson
    <mailto:esj@cs.fiu.edu> and Hitoshi Asaeda.

  - =main.c=: 1000000 usec -> 1 sec 0 usec.  Fix courtesy of the Kame project

  - =main.c:restart()= fixup courtesy of the Kame project

  - various min. message length check for the received control messages
    courtesy of the Kame project. XXX: the pimd check is not enough!

  - VIF name string comparison fix in =routesock.c:getmsg()= courtesy of the Kame
    project

  - missing brackets added inside =age_routes()= (a bug that will show up
    only if =KERNEL_MFC_WC_G= was defined); courtesy of the Kame project
 
* Version 2.1.0-alpha28: March 15, 2000

** Changes & New Features
  - added #ifdef =BROKEN_CISCO_CHECKSUM= (disabled by default) to make cisco RPs
    happy (read the comments in pim.c)

  - added #ifdef =PIM_TYPEVERS_DECL= in netinet/pim.h as a workaround that ANSI-C
    doesn't guarantee that bit-fields are tightly packed together (although all
    modern C compilers should not create a problem).

** Bug Fixes
  - Fixes to enable point-to-point interfaces being added correctly, thanks to
    Roger Venning <mailto:Roger.Venning@corpmail.telstra.com.au>

  - A number of minor bug fixes
 
* Version 2.1.0-alpha27: January 21, 2000
NB: this release may the the last one from 2.1.0.  The next release will be 2.2.0 and
    there will be lots of changes inside.

** Bug Fixes
  - Bug fix in =rp.c:add_grp_mask()= and =rp.c:delete_grp_mask()=: in some cases if
    the RPs are configured with nested multicast prefixes, the add/delete may
    fail.  Thanks to Hitoshi Asaeda and the KAME team for pointing out this one.

* Version 2.1.0-alpha26: October 28, 1999
** Bug Fixes
  - Bug fix in =receive_pim_register()= in =pim_proto.c:ntohl()= was missing
    inside =IN_MULTICAST()=. Thanks to Fred Griffoul <mailto:griffoul@ccrle.nec.de>

  - Bug report and fix by Hitoshi Asaeda <mailto:asaeda@yamato.ibm.co.jp> in
    =pim_proto.c:receive_pim_cand_rp_adv()= (if a router is not a BSR). Another bug
    in =rp.c:delete_grp_mask_entry()=: an entry not in the head of the list was not
    deleted propertly.

  - Some =VIFF_TUNNEL= checks added or deleted in various places.  Slowly preparing
    pimd to be able to work with GRE tunnels...

* Version 2.1.0-alpha25: August 30, 1999
Bug reports and fixes by Hitoshi Asaeda <mailto:asaeda@yamato.ibm.co.jp> inside
=parse_reg_threshold()= and =parse_data_threshold()= in config.c

** Changes & New Features
  - Successfully added multicast prefixes configured in pimd.conf are displayed at
    startup

  - Use =include/freebsd= as FreeBSD-3.x include files and =include/freebsd2= for
    FreeBSD-2.x.

** Bug Fixes
  - Test is performed whether a =PIM_REGISTER= has invalid source and/or group
    address of the internal packet.

* Version 2.1.0-alpha24: August  9, 1999
** Changes & New Features
  - =PIM_DEFAULT_CAND_RP_ADV_PERIOD= definition set to 60, but default 'time' value
    for inter Cand-RP messages is set in pimd.conf to 30 sec.

  - =PIM_REGISTER= checksum verification in =receive_pim_register()= relaxed for
    compatibility with some older routers.  The checksum has to be computed only over
    the first 8 bytes of the PIM Register (i.e. only over the header), but some older
    routers might compute it over the whole packet.  Hence, the checksum verification
    is over the first 8 bytes first, and if if it fails, then over the whole
    packet.  Thus, pimd that is RP should still work with older routers that act as
    DR, but if an older router is the RP, then pimd cannot be the DR.  Sorry, don't
    know which particular routers and models create the checksum over the whole PIM
    Register (if there are still any left).
    
* Version 2.1.0-alpha23: May 24, 1999
** Changes & New Features
  - Finally pimd works under Linux (probably 2.1.126, 2.2.x and 2.3.x).  However, a
    small fix in the kernel =linux/net/ipv4/ipmr.c= is necessary.  In function
    =pim_rcv()=, remove the call to =ip_compute_csum()=:

    Note that these 'preference' and 'metric' are like per iif.

  - =MRT_PIM= used (again) instead of =MRT_ASSERT= in kern.c.  The problem is that

  - =vif.c:zero_vif()=:  New function

** Bug Fixes
All bug reports thanks to Kaifu Wu <mailto:kaifu@3com.com>

  - Linux-related bug fixes regarding raw IP packets byte ordering

  - Join/Prune message bug fixed if the message contains several groups joined/pruned

* Version 2.1.0-alpha22: November 11, 1998
  Bug reports by Jonathan Day <mailto:jd9812@my-dejanews.com>

** Bug Fixes
  - Bug fixes to compile under newer Linux kernel (linux-2.1.127) To compile for
    older kernels ( ver < ???), add =-Dold_Linux= to the Makefile

  - For convenience, the =include/linux/netinet/{in.h,mroute.h}= files are added,
    with few modifications applied.

* Version 2.1.0-alpha21: November  4, 1998
** Bug Fixes
  - =pim_proto.c:join_or_prune()=: Bug fixes in case of (S,G) overlapping with
    (*,G).  Bug report by Dirk Ooms <mailto:Dirk.Ooms@alcatel.be>

  - =route.c:change_interfaces()=: Join/Prune (*,G), (*,*,RP) fire timer
    optimization/fix.

* Version 2.1.0-alpha20: August 26, 1998
** Changes & New Features
  - (Almost) all timers manipulation now use macros

  - =pim.h= and =pim_var.h= are in separate common directory

  - Added BSDI definition to =pim_var.h=, thanks to Hitoshi Asaeda.

** Bug Fixes
  - fix TIMEOUT definitions in difs.h (bug report by Nidhi Bhaskar)
    (originally, if timer value less than 5 seconds, it won't become 0)
    It is HIGHLY recommended to apply that fix, so here it is:
#+BEGIN_SRC c
-------------BEGIN BUG FIX-------------------
  1) Add the following lines to defs.h (after #define FALSE):

#ifndef MAX
#define MAX(a,b) (((a) >= (b))? (a) : (b))
#define MIN(a,b) (((a) <= (b))? (a) : (b))
#endif /* MAX & MIN */

  2) Change the listed below TIMEOUT macros to:

#define IF_TIMEOUT(timer)		\
	if (!((timer) -= (MIN(timer, TIMER_INTERVAL))))

#define IF_NOT_TIMEOUT(timer)		\
	if ((timer) -= (MIN(timer, TIMER_INTERVAL)))

#+END_SRC

* Version 2.1.0-alpha19: July 29, 1998
Both bug reports by Chirayu Shah <mailto:shahzad@torrentnet.com>-

** Bug Fixes
  - bug fix in =find_route()= when searching for (*,*,RP)

  - bug fix in =move_kernel_cache()=: no need to do =move_kernel_cache()=
    from (*,*,R) to (*,G) first when we call =move_kernel_cache()= for (S,G)

* Version 2.1.0-alpha18: May 29, 1998
** Changes & New Features
  - Now compiles under Linux (haven't checked whether the PIMv2 kernel support in
    linux-2.1.103 works)

** Bug Fixes
  - =parse_default_source*()= bug fix (bug reports by Nidhi Bhaskar)

  - allpimrouters deleted from igmp.c (already defined in pim.c)

  - igmpmsg defined for IRIX 

* Version 2.1.0-alpha17: May 21, 1998
** Changes & New Features
  - (*,G) MFC kernel support completed and verified.  Compile with =KERNEL_MFC_WC_G=
    defined in Makefile, but then must use it only with a kernel that supports (*,G),
    e.g. =pimkern-PATCH_7=.  Currently, kernel patches available for FreeBSD and
    SunOS only.

** Bug Fixes
  - =MRTF_MFC_CLONE_SG= flag set after =delete_single_kernel_cache()= is called
 
* Version 2.1.0-alpha16: May 19, 1998
** Changes & New Features
  - PIM registers kernel encapsulation support.  Build with =PIM_REG_KERNEL_ENCAP=
    defined in Makefile.

  - (*,G) MFC support.  Build with =KERNEL_MFC_WC_G= defined in Makefile. However,
    =MFC_WC_G= is still not supported with =pimkern-PATCH_6=, must disable it for now.

  - =mrt.c:delete_single_kernel_cache_addr()=: New function, uses source, group to
    specify an MFC to be deleted

* Version 2.1.0-alpha15: May 14, 1998
  - Another few bug fixes related to NetBSD definitions thanks to Heiko W.Rupp
    <mailto:hwr@pilhuhn.de>

* Version 2.1.0-alpha14: May 12, 1998
  - A few bug fixes related to NetBSD definitions thanks to Heiko W.Rupp
    <mailto:hwr@pilhuhn.de>

* Version 2.1.0-alpha13: May 11, 1998
** Changes & New Features
  - If the RP changes, the necessary actions are taken to pass the new RP address to
    the kernel. To be used for kernel register encap.  support. Wnat needs to be done
    is: (a) add =rp_addr= entry to the mfcctl structure, and then just set it in
    =kern.c:k_chf_mfc()=.  Obviously, the kernel needs to support the register
    encapsulation (instead of sending WHOLEPKT to the user level). In the near few
    days will make the necessary kernel changes.

  - =change_interfaces()=: Added "flags" argument.  The only valid flag is
    =MFC_UPDATE_FORCE=, used for forcing kernel call when only the RP changes.

  - =k_chg_mfc()= has a new argument: rp_addr. To be used for kernel register
    encapsulation support

  - =MRT_PIM= completely replaced by =MRT_ASSERT=

  - =move_kernel_cache()=: Argument =MFC_MOVE_FORCE= is a flag instead of TRUE/FALSE

  - =process_cache_miss()=: removed unneeded piece of code

* Version 2.1.0-alpha12: May 10, 1998
** Changes & New Features
   - Use the cleaned up =netinet/pim.h=

   - Remove the no needed anymore pim header definition in =pimd.h=

   - Don't use =MRT_PIM= in in kern.c anymore, replaced back with =MRT_ASSERT=.

   - =added default_source_metric= and =default_source_preference= (1024) because the
     kernel's unicast routing table is not a good source of info; configurable in
     pimd.conf

   - Can now compile under NetBSD-1.3, thanks to Heiko W.Rupp <mailto:hwr@pilhuhn.de>

** Bug Fixes
   - Incorrect setup of the borderBit and nullRegisterBit (different for big and
     little endian machines) fixed; =*_BORDER_BIT= and =*NULL_REGISTER_BIT= redefined

   - don't send =pim_assert= on tunnels or register vifs (if for whatever reason we
     receive on such interface)

   - ignore =WRONGVIF= messages for register and tunnel vifs (the cleaned up
     kernel mods dont send such signal, but the older (before May 9 '98) pimd
     mods that signaling was enabled

* Version 2.1.0-alpha11: March 16, 1998
** Changes & New Features
   - =vif.c:find_vif_direct_local()=: New function, used in =routesock.c=, =igmp_proto.c=

   - Use =MFC_MOVE_FORCE/MFC_MOVE_DONT_FORCE= flag in =mrt.c=, =route.c=,
     =pim_proto.c=, when need to move the kernel cache entries between (*,*,RP),
     (*,G), (S,G)

   - new timer related macros: =SET_TIMER()=, =FIRE_TIMER()=, =IF_TIMER_SET()=,
     =IF_TIMER_NOT_SET()=

** Bug Fixes
   - =timer.c:age_routes()=: bunch of fixes regarding J/P message fragmentation

   - =route.c:process_wrong_iif()=: (S,G) SPT switch bug fix: ANDed =MRTF_RP=
     fixed to =MRTF_RP=

   - =pim_proto.c= & =timer.c=: (S,G) Prune now is sent toward RP, when iif
     toward S and iif toward RP are different

   - =pim_proto.c:join_or_prune()= bug fixes

   - =pim_proto.c=: (S,G)Prune entry's timer now set to J/P message holdtime

   - =pim_proto.c:receive_pim_join_prune()=: Ensure pruned interfaces are correctly
     reestablished

   - =timer.c:age_routes()=: now (S,G) entry with local members (inherited from
     (*,G)) is timeout propertly

   - =timer.c:age_routes()=: (S,G) J/P timer restarted propertly

   - =timer.c:age_routes()=: check also the (S,G)RPbit entries in the forwarders and
     RP and eventually switch to the shortest path if data rate too high

   - =route.c:process_wrong_vif()= fire J/P timer

   - =route.c:switch_shortest_path()=: reset the iif toward S if there is already
     (S,G)RPbit entry

* Version 2.1.0-alpha10: March 3, 1998
Temp. non-public release.

** Changes & New Features
   - `interval` can be applied for data rate check.  The statement in =pimd.conf=
     that only the default value will be used is not true anymore.

   - The RP-initiated and the forwarder-initiated (S,G) switch threshold rate
     can be different.

   - =pim_proto.c:receive_pim_register()=: check if I am the RP for that group,
     and if "no", send =PIM_REGISTER_STOP= (XXX: not in the spec, but should be!)

   - =pim_proto.c:receive_pim_register_stop()=: check if the =PIM_REGISTER_STOP=
     originator is really the RP, before suppressing the sending of the PIM
     registers.  (XXX: not in the spec but should be there)

   - =rp.c:check_mrtentry_rp()=: new function added to check whether the RP
     address is the corresponding one for the given mrtentry

   - =debug.c:dump_mrt()= timer values added

   - =route.c=: =add_leaf()=, =process_cache_miss()=, =process_wrong_iif()=
     no routing entries created for the LAN scoped addresses

   - =DEBUG_DVMRP_DETAIL= and =DEBUG_PIM_DETAIL= added

** Bug Fixes
   - =mrt.c:add_kernel_cache()=: no kernel cache duplicates

   - =mrt.c:move_kernel_cache()=: if the iif of the (*,*,R) (or (*,G))
     and (S,G) are different, dont move the cache entry "UP"

   - =timer.c:age_routes()=: (S,G) =add_jp_entry()= flag fixed, SPT switch related.

   - =kern.c:k_get_sg_cnt()=: modified to compensate for the kernel's return code
     bug for getting (S,G) byte count (=SIOCGETSGCNT=)

   - =pim_proto.c:receive_pim_register()=: if the (S,G) oif is NULL, now
     checks whether the iif is =register_vif=

* Version 2.1.0-alpha9: February 18, 1997
** Changes & New Features
   - "non-commersial" statement deleted from the copyright message

   - mrinfo support added

   - mtrace support added (not completed and not enough tested)

   - if invalid local address for =cand_rp= or =cand_bootstrap_router= in =pimd.conf=,
     automatically will use the largest local multicast enabled address

   - "include" directory for FreeBSD and SunOS added, so now pimd can be compiled
     without having the necesary "include" files added to your system. Probably a bad
     idea and may remove it later.

   - some default values for the IP headers of the IGMP and PIM packets are fixed

   - =VIFF_PIM_NBR= and =VIFF_DVMRP_NBR= flags added

   - =VIFF_REGISTER= now included in the RSRR vifs report

   - =find_route()= debug messages removed
